# TrypRNAseq
The TrypRNAseq pipeline is designed to take raw Illumina reads, does quality control, removal of overrepresented sequences and alignes the processed reads to a genome. In the end it counts the reads to a user-supplied .gtf file and produces a tab-sepparated file summarizing its results. Users should only specify in the beginning parameters which are asked for in a command-line dialogue.

## Dependencies
All dependencies need to be reachable via the command line.
